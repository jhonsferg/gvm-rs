//! Command-line interface definition.
//!
//! This module declares the top-level [`Cli`] struct and the [`Command`] enum
//! that together form the complete CLI surface of `gvm`. Every subcommand,
//! flag, and argument is defined here using [`clap`]'s derive macros.
//! The doc-comment on each variant becomes the help text shown by `gvm --help`.
